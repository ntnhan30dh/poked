    "Story h2": "Let yourself be taken on a food-cation with Poked, delivering the tropical taste of Hawaii’s national dish directly to you - like beach-side service.",
    "Story p1": "Poké, which means “cut into small pieces”, features simple ingredients, but once combined and finished with toppings of your choice - that’s when the vibrant flavours really hit you! Whether a light lunch or colourful healthy dinner, you can personalise your bowl to create the perfect blend.",
    "Story p2": " All bowls are served with rice and paired with seafood, meat or veggies - all ready for you to tuck in! And if you close your eyes, you’ll hear the waves crash against the Hawaiian shore with every mouthful."
